# Prison Run
## Basis
Prison Run is a free to play action game in which you are on the run from prison guards. More and more of these guards will chase you, and to survive you must think fast as the game speeds up and choose the correct multiplier. You can find it either here or on the Google Play Store as "Prison Run" by Micro Transaction Mania, LLC.
## Controls
When you start the game, your character will begin running forward. There is no way to stop this forward motion unless dieing counts for you. You can touch and drag the screen to move your character from side to side on the road, but you will be unable to move onto the surrounding terrain.
